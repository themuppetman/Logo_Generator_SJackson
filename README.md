# SJs_SVG_Logo_Gen

## Description

```
The application allows the user to generate basic SVG logo file based on the users answers on the following questsions:
  - Logo text (3 letters Max)
  - Filename
  - Text Color
  - Shape Choice (Circle, Triangle, Square)
  - Shape Color
```

### User Story

```
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```



## Additional Requirements

This Challenge combines many of the skills covered so far. In addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria, we’ve provided some guidelines to help you get started.

Because this Challenge requires a video submission, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog video submission guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) for guidance on creating and sharing a video.

Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Recommended Directory Structure

```md
.  
├── examples/           // Example svg file(s) created with the app
├── lib/                // Folder for classes or functions
    ├── shapes.js       // Exports `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes
    ├── shapes.test.js  // Jest tests for shapes
    └── more...         // Additional files and tests
├── .gitignore          // Indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
├── index.js            // Runs the application using imports from lib/
├── package.json
└── README.md           // App description, link to video, setup and usage instructions           
```

> **Important**: Make sure that you remove `dist` from the `.gitignore` file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.
The application must include `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. While not a requirement, it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes in a parent `Shape` class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.

Each shape class should be tested for a `render()` method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.

The following example test should pass:

```js
const shape = new Triangle();
shape.setColor("blue");
expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');
```

You may need to add additional files in the `lib` folder for handling user input, writing to a file, etc. Writing tests for these additional files is **optional**.
